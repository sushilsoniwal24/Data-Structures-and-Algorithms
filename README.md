## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in a separate Java class file. The classes can be used directly by importing them into your own Java code.

To run the examples and test cases for each data structure and algorithm, clone the repository and run the individual Java class files using the following command:

```
java classname
```

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you find any bugs or issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request. 

Please ensure that any new data structures or algorithms that you contribute are well documented, with clear explanations of their purpose and how to use them.
